# LieAlgebra
# Lie Algebra Project

## Overview
This project explores **Lie Algebra** using Python, implementing key mathematical concepts and computational techniques. It provides a structured approach to understanding and working with Lie algebras through Python code.

## Features
- **Lie Brackets Implementation**: Compute Lie brackets for given elements.
- **Basis and Structure Constants**: Define basis and calculate structure constants.
- **Algebraic Properties**: Verify anti-symmetry and Jacobi identity.
- **Matrix Representations**: Work with Lie algebras in matrix form.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of algebraic structures.

## Installation
To run this project, you need Python and the required libraries. Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## File Structure
- `2nd_year_project.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing code and explanations.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Code Explanation
The project follows a modular approach, breaking down Lie algebra computations into logical steps:

1. **Importing Libraries**
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import sympy as sp
   ```
   - `numpy`: For numerical computations
   - `sympy`: For symbolic algebra operations

2. **Defining Lie Brackets**
   ```python
   def lie_bracket(A, B):
       return A @ B - B @ A
   ```
   - Computes the Lie bracket [A, B] = AB - BA

3. **Verifying Properties**
   - **Anti-Symmetry**: Ensures that [A, B] = -[B, A]
   - **Jacobi Identity**: Checks if [A, [B, C]] + [B, [C, A]] + [C, [A, B]] = 0

4. **Working with Structure Constants**
   - Defines basis elements
   - Computes structure constants

5. **Matrix Representations**
   - Constructs matrix representations of Lie algebras

6. **Visualization**
   - Uses matplotlib or other tools for graphical representation

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell step by step to explore Lie algebra computations interactively.

## Example
Example computation of Lie brackets:
```python
A = np.array([[0, 1], [-1, 0]])
B = np.array([[0, 2], [-2, 0]])
print(lie_bracket(A, B))
```

## Applications
- **Physics**: Used in quantum mechanics and gauge theories.
- **Mathematics**: Foundational to algebraic structures.
- **Engineering**: Useful in control systems and robotics.
